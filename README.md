## Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to the field of Computer Graphics. We will cover the basic mathematical concepts, such as 2D and 3D transformations, study the interaction of light with geometry to derive shading models, and implement rendering algorithms such as ray tracing and rasterization. We will investigate how these fundamental components are integrated in current graphics processors and study the corresponding programming APIs. This course will also include a brief introduction to C++.

By the end of the course, the student must be able to:

* Explain and apply the fundamental mathematical concepts used in image synthesis algorithms
* Implement a basic rendering system based on ray tracing
* Implement a basic rendering pipeline based on rasterization
* Develop graphics programs in C++ using the Simple Directmedia Library (SDL)

### Topics

* 3D Transformations
* Viewing 3D scenes
* Shading
* Rendering pipeline and the GPU
* Texturing
* Polygonal meshes and other modelling techniques
* Colour spaces
* Light and colour
* Ray-geometry intersection
* Ray tracing

### Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, the students will design, program, and analyze algorithms and systems for interactive 3D shape modeling and digital geometry processing.
